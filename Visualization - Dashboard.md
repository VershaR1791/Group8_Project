# Group8_Project_Final Project: Investing in Residential Properties in New York City

## Dashboard
The final dashboard will be a website created through **JavaScript**. The website will have 2 sections.

**Section 1** will be user self serve information that will include:

- Sales price trends in different NYC boroughs visualized through simple line graphs built in **Tableau**.
- Sales price trends in different building types visualized through trend lines built in **Tableau**.
- A NYC map will be built using **JavaScript** and **GoogleMaps API**. Using **d3.JSON** the map will include Markers to indicate:
  - Sales Price
  - Neighborhood
  - Address
  - Property Type
  - Zip Code
  - Square Feet
- The map will be interactive that will display information such as _"Sales Price", "Address", "Zip Code"_ & _"Property Type"_ while hovering over the Marker

**Section 2** will be the interactve section where users will provide inputs of:
- Square Feet
- Budget Range
- Borough (Optional)
through a dropdown menu option built using **JavaScript**.

The output will provide:  
- top 3 choices to the user of properties(address) that they could invest in, 
- the 3 addresses will also be displayed on a map built through **JavaScript** & **GoogleMaps API** and 
- a **Machine Learning** output which displays how the sales price of the 3 properties provided through the output will grow through the next 5 years.

## Static Visualization

Some graphs to show trend of Sales Price through years in different boroughs were built using Tableau.

## Map visualization

- The map was built using **JavaScript** and **GeoMaps API**. 
- The Sale_join_Address database was filtered using **Python (CoLab)** to only incude **0.04%** of database. Including 400K+ data would make the map on JavaScript difficult to visualize and load.
- API call was made to pull in **Latitude** and **Longitude** for each line of address.

- The dataframe was then converted to **.json** format.

- The visualization has an interactive element where we can switch between _'Street', 'Satellite'_ and _'Dark'_ view

## Final WebPage

Here is the (live)[https://www.loom.com/share/b6c40b0a28434033a3745be86d407e06] video demo of the webpage.
Our Final Visualization includes:
- The dashboard has been made interactive to include historical sales price data by borough for 13 years and shows the trend in sales price built in Tableau.
- It also provides an interactive map with locations of all addresses and their corresponding data such as neighborhood, square feet and average sales price through the years.
- It also provides a sample database which the home buyers could download as a csv in the future. The database provides the predicted current price for 2021.

- We will want to enable filter capabilities for the database in the future.
