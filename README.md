### Dashboard

The final dashboard will be a website created through **Flask** using different **routes**. The website will have 2 sections.

**Section 1** will be user self serve information that will include:

- Sales price trends in different NYC boroughs visualized through simple line graphs built in **python**.
- Sales price trends in different building types visualized through trend lines built in **python**.
- A NYC map will be built using **JavaScript** and **GoogleMaps API**. Using **d3.JSON** the map will include circleMarkers to indicate sales price which will have
  - a different color based on the sales price range and
  - different radii based on the sales price amount
- The map will be interactive that will display information such as _"Sales Price", "Address", "Postal Code"_ & _"Property Type"_ while hovering over the CircleMarker

**Section 2** will be the interactve section where users will provide inputs of:
- Property Type
- Budget Range
- Borough
through a picklist option.

The output will provide:  
- top 3 choices to the user of properties(address) that they could invest in, 
- the 3 addresses will also be displayed on a map built through **JavaScript** & **GoogleMaps API** and 
- a **Machine Learning** output which displays how the sales price of the 3 properties provided through the output will grow through the next 5 years.
