## Machine Learning Overview
###
As the desired output of our machine learning model is a predication of the percentage increase in property value we will be looking at the following data:
  - 10 years of property sales data by borough in NYC for the training set, additional 5 years of property sales will be used to test our model
  - Input features from our database will be the following:
      - Building Class Category
      - Neighborhood
      - Address
      - Zip Code
      - Gross Square Feet
      - Sale Price
      - Year
      - Sales Date
      - Residential


The target output will be "Sale Price".  As the target output is continuous data we will be using a supervised machine learning model- multiple linear regression model.
